### Backup and Restore
In this lab, we will deploy application in a region and then use AWS Backup and EC2 AMIs to create a backup of our store in another region. We will demonstrate DR by simulating a disaster in the primary region and recovering application in the Backup Region. This module  takes about 90 minutes to complete.
