This application is launch in a EC2 Instance (t3.small) with a dedicated VPC using a Public Subnet. Note that this is not the ideal infrastructure architecture for running highly availability production applications but suffices for this workshop.\nTo configure a infrastructure and deploy the application, we will use Cloudformation. Cloudformation is an easy way to speed up cloud provisioning with infrastructure as code.\nWe will initially deploy Unishop to the ap-southeast-1 AWS Region and verify functionality. Then we will use an AWS EC2 AMI and AWS Backup for creating copies of application server and database in ap-southeast-2 region. Finally, we will use the copies for creating and testing a fully functional application in ap-southeast-2 region. "
